Backbone-UI is a JavaScript user interface framework that aims to acheive the following goals:

* To work intimitely with the Backbone.Model and Backbone.Collection concepts to bind particular pieces of data to their associated representation in the DOM.

* To embrace the DOM, warts and all, as opposed to adding a level of indirection with view templates.

* To provide a consistent, skinnable look-and-feel to form elements across all modern browsers.  

* To stay out of your way when laying out your views.  This framework is about generating and maintaining content, not layout.
